## How it works

This projects simulates [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in hardware on a small (32x16) grid with periodic boundary conditions.

VGA output of the simulation state is also exposed on the bidirectional pins, that are all configured as outputs and wired to work with a [TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga).

## How to test

## External hardware

[TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) for VGA output.
